## Description

Clear Skies is a mobile app built with Flutter and Dart, designed to deepen my skills in object-oriented programming, static typing, and class-based structures. This app fetches real-time weather data, allowing users to search for any city or location and view its current weather status. The interface dynamically adjusts colours and icons based on live weather conditions, providing an intuitive and visually engaging experience.
